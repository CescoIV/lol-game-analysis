## data-grabber

these are the tools that grab data from lolesports when a game is live, and merge it into a full dataset for the viz. very messy/hacky, so not really well documented, but brief how to use it:

```bash
mkdir games
node index.js # run this while games are live, ideally just keep this on a long running process on a server
```
